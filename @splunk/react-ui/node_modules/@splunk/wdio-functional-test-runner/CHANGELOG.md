* The `ci` block setting `customJUnit` is deprecated and will be removed in the next major release.
    * Use `failOnEmptySuite` instead.

API Changes:

Republished 6.0.0 which is missing files.

6.0.0 - March 20, 2018
----------
New Features:
* Added functionality to use an AWS S3 bucket instead of a local HTTP server in fixture mode.
* Mocha's `retries` feature is now enabled by default and set to `2`.

Bug Fixes:
* The Splunk login helper is more resilient now (SUI-1417, getUrl/isExisting timeouts).

API Changes:
* HTTP serving of fixtures is no longer enabled by default in fixture mode. Migrating projects should:
    * Import and enable the new `httpServer` block in their profiles:
    ```js
    const httpServer = require('@splunk/wdio-functional-test-runner/functional.httpServer').default;
    [...]
    httpServer(config);
    ```

5.0.0 - February 14, 2018
----------
Bug Fixes:
* No longer crashes with latest ORCA versions (SUI-1380).

API Changes:
* The default password the Splunk login helper uses is now `Chang3d!`.
  * Projects that have their CI pinned to older ORCA releases should either upgrade ORCA or
  override this setting (to `changed`).
* Custom ORCA settings don't need to be escaped anymore.

4.2.0 - January 4, 2017
----------
New Features:
* Added custom JUnit reporter to handle empty suite results better (SUI-1240).

Bug Fixes:
* Compiled specs from previous runs are no longer included in the current spec list in certain configurations.

4.1.0 - December 1, 2017
----------
New Features:
* Added Sauce ID reporter (SUI-1254).
* Added `when` setting to ORCA building block (SUI-1090).
  * Can be set to `global` to use a single ORCA deployment for all tests.  

Changes:
* The `ci` building block now assumes SauceLabs is used and enables the ID reporter by default.
  * Projects that aren't using SauceLabs (but are using the `ci` block) should change their `ci` calls to:
`ci(config, { sauce: false });`

4.0.0 - November 20, 2017
----------
New Features:
* Added support for overriding the temporary directory (`temp` setting) (SUI-1161).
* Added support for sharing fixtures between specs (SUI-1162).
* Increased fixture compilation performance (SUI-1208).

API Changes:
* Replaced util constants for telling browser type (`isIE`, `isChrome`, ...) with functions (SUI-1235).

Bug Fixes:
* The base configuration no longer sets the log level to the invalid value `info` (SUI-1251).

3.0.0 - September 25, 2017
----------
New Features:
* Added support for remote server testing.
* Added helpers to create/destroy a remote server setup using ORCA.
* Added a helper that navigates to an app page and logs in if required.
* Simplified configuration handling (removed `--runnerConfig`).
* Fixture files are now compiled using Webpack.
* Added `focusOnSelector` to utils (SUI-1100).

API Changes:
* Runner configuration is now called Settings to differentiate it from webdriverio profiles.
Also, settings are no longer read from a file, and the base configuration module now exports a
function accepting settings instead. Migrating projects should:
    * Replace all imports of `const config = [...]/functional.base.conf` with `const base = [...]/functional.base`
    * Add statements to their profiles to create the base config before passing it to subsequent
    building blocks:
    ```js
    const settings = require('./functional.settings');
    const config = base(settings);
    ```
    * It's recommended to rename your settings file from `functional.runner.conf.js` to `functional.settings.js`.
    * `--runnerConfig` should be removed from tasks defined in `package.json`.
* The runner now defaults to remote server mode. Migrating projects should add `fixtureMode`: `true`
to their runner configuration to reactivate fixture compilation and serving.
* The runner setting `webpackProfile` was renamed to `fixtureWebpackProfile`.
* Fixture files are no longer transpiled using `babel-register`, they are now compiled using
Webpack. This may result in different output. The new setting `specWebpackProfile` can be used to
apply custom webpack configuration, if necessary.

2.0.1 - July 31, 2017
----------
* Added `fixtureTemplate` setting to runner configuration.
* Runner logging is now less verbose by default.
* Added `--runnerVerbose` option to enable previous logging behavior.

2.0.0 - July 24, 2017
----------
API Changes:
* Build artifacts are now located in the package root (instead of `/lib`), and `client/util` was renamed
to `utils`. Find and replace all imports of `@splunk/wdio-functional-test-runner/lib/` with
`@splunk/wdio-functional-test-runner/`, then rename all imports of
`@splunk/wdio-functional-test-runner/client/util` to `@splunk/wdio-functional-test-runner/utils`.

Miscellaneous:
* Removed dependency `wdio-webpack-service`.
* Updated dependencies (including `webdriverio`).
* Resolved Webpack v1/v2 clash (SUI-903).
* `isIE` no longer returns a false positive for Microsoft Edge (SUI-802).

1.1.0 - May 25, 2017
----------
The name of the package was changed from `splunk-ui-functional-test-runner` to `@splunk/wdio-functional-test-runner`.

To upgrade:
* Uninstall `splunk-ui-functional-test-runner`.
* Install `@splunk/wdio-functional-test-runner`.
* Find and replace all imports of `splunk-ui-functional-test-runner` with `@splunk/wdio-functional-test-runner`.
* In your package.json update scripts that call `splunk-ui-functional-test-runner` to call `splunk-wdio-functional-test-runner` instead.

New Feature:
* Added code coverage support.

1.0.1 - April 20, 2017
