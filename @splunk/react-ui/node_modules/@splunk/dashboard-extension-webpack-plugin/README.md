# Dashboard Extension Webpack Plugin

A webpack plugin for building Splunk dashboard extensions.

It will replace the initial define with a require so that the extension module is executed.

Consider using the dashboard configuration file provided by [`@splunk/webpack-configs/dashboard.config`](/Packages/webpack-configs/Overview) instead of using this plugin directly.
